      "text": "The SAR narrative is the primary free-text explanation of suspicious activity and is often critical to law enforcement investigations. Filings must be complete, sufficient, and timely. Incomplete, disorganized, or blank narratives reduce investigative value. The narrative should be clear, concise, and thorough, and institutions must file within regulatory deadlines.",
      "practical_guidance": "Narrative quality is not optional. Write for investigators who were not present for internal review.",

      "text": "A sufficient SAR narrative should explicitly cover who conducted the activity, what instruments or mechanisms were used, when the activity occurred, where it occurred (including branches and foreign jurisdictions), why it is suspicious relative to expected customer behavior, and how the activity was carried out (method of operation).",

Common indicators include no clear lawful purpose, activity inconsistent with stated business, complex layering across accounts/jurisdictions, repetitive or unusually high wire patterns, mixed instrument deposits, short burst activity in dormant accounts, possible shell entities, and transactions designed to evade reporting requirements.",
