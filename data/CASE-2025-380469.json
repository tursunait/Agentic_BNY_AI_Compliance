 "narrative": "This Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is filed to document unusual cash activity and potential structuring involving Global Trade Corp, an individual with a Low risk rating. The activity was flagged under Alert ALRT-74599 generated by the ML Risk Model v2 due to unusual cash patterns and multiple day deposits. Between March 15, 2024, and April 15, 2024, the subject engaged in a series of cash deposits followed by immediate wire transfers, totaling approximately $45,000. On March 18, 2024, a cash deposit of $9,500 was made, followed by a wire transfer to a destination account in Miami, FL. This was succeeded by another cash deposit of $9,800 on March 25, 2024, with a subsequent wire transfer to a different beneficiary. Additional transactions included a cash deposit of $9,700 on April 2, 2024, and a wire transfer, followed by a $9,900 cash deposit on April 10, 2024, again resulting in a wire transfer to another beneficiary. The final transaction occurred on April 15, 2024, with a cash deposit of $6,200 and an immediate wire transfer, completing a pattern of structured transactions designed to avoid Currency Transaction Report (CTR) thresholds. The rapid movement of funds, lack of apparent business purpose, and the subject's refusal to explain the large cash deposits raise concerns regarding potential money laundering activities. This report is submitted for further regulatory review."
