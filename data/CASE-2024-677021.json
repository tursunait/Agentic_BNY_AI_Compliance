  "narrative": "This Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is filed to document unusual cash deposit patterns and potential money laundering activities associated with Global Trade Corp, an individual with a Medium risk rating. The activity was flagged under Alert ALRT-78051 generated by the ML Risk Model v2 due to unusual cash patterns and multiple day deposits. Between March 15, 2024, and March 22, 2024, the subject engaged in a series of cash deposits and funds transfers totaling approximately $25,500. On March 15, 2024, a cash deposit of $9,500 was made from account XXXXXX0001 in Miami, FL, followed by an immediate wire transfer. On March 18, 2024, another cash deposit of $8,000 occurred from the same account, leading to a smaller wire transfer. Finally, on March 22, 2024, a funds transfer of $8,000 was executed, with the total amounts of these transactions remaining just below the Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold. The pattern of multiple transactions below the CTR threshold, combined with the rapid movement of funds and the use of multiple accounts, raises concerns regarding structuring and suggests a lack of apparent lawful purpose for these transactions. The subject declined to explain the large cash deposits, and there is an adverse media report indicating that the subject is under investigation."
