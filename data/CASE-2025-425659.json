 "narrative": "This Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is filed to document suspicious cash deposit and funds transfer activities associated with Global Trade Corp, a business with a Low risk rating in the Import/Export industry. The activity was flagged under Alert ALRT-68434 by the ML Risk Model v2 due to unusual cash patterns and multiple day deposits. Between January 15, 2024, and February 20, 2024, the subject engaged in a series of cash deposits totaling $45,000, with individual transactions structured to remain below the Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold. Specifically, on January 15, 2024, a cash deposit of $9,000 was made, followed by deposits of $8,500 on January 20, 2024, and $9,500 on January 25, 2024, all originating from the same account and directed to a common destination account. Additionally, on February 10, 2024, a wire transfer of $18,000 was executed to an unrelated offshore entity, further raising concerns regarding the purpose of these transactions. The pattern of structuring cash deposits, combined with the significant wire transfer to an offshore entity, appears inconsistent with the subject's stated business purpose and raises concerns of potential money laundering. The subject declined to explain the large cash deposits, and there is an adverse media report indicating the subject is under investigation. This report is submitted for regulatory review."
